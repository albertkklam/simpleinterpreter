Let’s build a simple interpreter! This respository is based off the [Let's Build A Simple Interpreter](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/) series by Ruslan Spivak. 

Follow along on what's happening:
- [x] Modify the code to allow multiple-digit integers in the input, for example “12+3”
- [x] Add a method that skips whitespace characters so that your calculator can handle inputs with whitespace characters like ” 12 + 3”
- [x] Modify the code and instead of ‘+’ handle ‘-‘ to evaluate subtractions like “7-5”
- [x] Extend the calculator to handle multiplication of two integers
- [x] Extend the calculator to handle division of two integers
- [x] Modify the code to interpret expressions containing an arbitrary number of additions and subtractions, for example “9 - 5 + 3 + 11”
- [ ] Modify the source code of the calculator to interpret arithmetic expressions that contain only multiplication and division, for example “7 * 4 / 2 * 3”.
